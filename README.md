## üß† What is a Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques.  
It's a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

- **Plaintext:** `HELLO`
- **Ciphertext:** `KHOOR`

This method was reportedly used by Julius Caesar to communicate with his generals.

## üöÄ Features

- **Encryption:** Convert your plaintext messages into ciphertext by shifting letters.
- **Decryption:** Revert your ciphertext back to plaintext using the correct shift value.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line prompts guide you through the process.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that the shift value is within the acceptable range.
